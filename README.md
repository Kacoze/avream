AVream turns your Android phone into a Linux virtual camera and microphone for real meetings and recordings.

If you are looking for an Android phone as webcam on Linux, Android as microphone on Linux, or a reliable Linux virtual camera bridge for Zoom, Google Meet, and OBS, AVream is built for exactly that workflow.

## Why AVream

- No dedicated app required on the phone.
- Phone-first UX: scan phone, select device, start camera.
- USB and Wi-Fi modes with practical reconnect flow.
- Works as standard Linux devices: `AVream Camera` and `AVream Mic`.
- Includes both GUI (`avream-ui`) and CLI (`avream`).
- Security model based on polkit helper actions (no `sudo` in GUI controls).

## Works With

- Google Meet
- Zoom
- OBS Studio
- Other apps that support Linux V4L2 camera and Pulse/PipeWire microphone devices

## Quickstart (Recommended)

1. Download the latest monolithic package from Releases and install it:

```bash
sudo apt install ./avream_1.0.0_amd64.deb
```

2. Launch AVream GUI:

```bash
avream-ui
```

3. On first launch, if daemon lock screen appears, click `Enable AVream Service`.
4. Connect phone with USB, unlock it, and accept USB debugging authorization.
5. Click `Scan Phones`, select your device, then click `Use Selected Phone`.
6. Click `Start Camera`.
7. In your conferencing app, choose `AVream Camera` (and optionally `AVream Mic`).

## CLI Quickstart

```bash
avream status
avream devices
avream start --mode wifi --lens front
avream camera stop
```

See `docs/CLI_README.md` for full command reference.

## Install Options

- Recommended: `avream_<version>_amd64.deb` (single package).
- Advanced Debian split bundle: `avream-deb-split_<version>_amd64.tar.gz` (contains `avream-daemon`, `avream-ui`, `avream-helper`, `avream-meta`).

## Architecture

- `avreamd`: user daemon exposing JSON API over UNIX socket.
- `avream-ui`: GTK4/libadwaita desktop application.
- `avream-helper`: privileged helper for selected system actions via polkit.

## Known Limits

- PC audio output to phone speaker is not in stable baseline.
- Preview runs as a separate `scrcpy` window, not embedded in GTK content.
