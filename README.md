## Why Users Pick AVream

- No dedicated app required on the phone.
- Clean phone-first UX: scan phone, connect, start camera.
- USB and Wi-Fi modes with practical reconnect flow.
- Works as standard Linux devices: `AVream Camera` and `AVream Mic`.
- Stable Linux-native pipeline (daemon + UI + helper), built for real calls.
- Security model based on polkit helper actions (no random `sudo` commands in GUI).

## Works With

- Google Meet
- Zoom
- OBS Studio
- Other apps that support Linux V4L2 camera and Pulse/PipeWire microphone devices
